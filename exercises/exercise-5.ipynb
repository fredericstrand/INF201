    "In this exercise, you will implement two functions that perform vector addition. A vector can be represented as a list of numbers in Python (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a function called inplace_add_vectors(vec1, vec2):\n",
    "\n",
    "* This function should add the corresponding elements of vec2 to vec1.\n",
    "* After calling this function, vec1 should be modified to hold the sum of the two vectors.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "    - v1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    - v2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "    - inplace_add_vectors(v1, v2)\n",
    "    - print(v1) # Output: [5, 7, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a function called add_vectors(vec1, vec2):\n",
    "* This function should return a new vector where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from vec1 and vec2.\n",
    "* The input vectors (vec1 and vec2) should remain unchanged.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "    - v1 = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    - v2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "    - v3 = add_vectors(v1, v2)\n",

To compute the dominant eigenvalue, take a random vector  with 50 entries and multiply it by , leading to . Set  and repeat the process. That is, with our new , compute , set  and proceed. You can use numpy functionality to compute multiplications and norms.  After 100 iterations, print out the value of  which approximates the dominant eigenvalue. Check the result by computing Lambda, V = np.linalg.eig(A) and inspecting the largest absolute value in Lambda."
