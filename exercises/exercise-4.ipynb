    "You are tasked with managing directories for a simple project. You will create a project folder, check if certain subdirectories exist, and create them if they don't. You will also learn how to work with both local and global paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a function to set up a project directory in the current working directory. The project name is specified as input to the function.\n",
    "2. Inside the project folder, the function creates two subdirectories:\n",
    "data\n",
    "output\n",
    "3. Always check if a directory already exists. If it does, print a warning and abort.\n",
    "4. The function should create a file inside the data folder named data.txt.\n",
    "5. After calling the function, check that all directories have been created, and if so, print out their global path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "* Use Path.cwd() for the current working directory.\n",
    "* Use Path.mkdir() to create directories and handle exceptions if they already exist.\n",
    "* Use Path.exists() to check if a folder exists.\n",
    "* Use Path.touch() to create an empty file.\n",
